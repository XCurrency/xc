#start-many Setup Guide

## Two Options for Setting up your Wallet
There are many ways to setup a wallet to support start-many. This guide will walk through two of them.

1. [Importing an existing wallet (recommended if you are consolidating wallets).](#option1)
2. [Sending 10,000 BlocknetDX to new wallet addresses.](#option2)

## <a name="option1"></a>Option 1. Importing an existing wallet

This is the way to go if you are consolidating multiple wallets into one that supports start-many. 

### From your single-instance ServiceNode Wallet

Open your QT Wallet and go to console (from the menu select Tools => Debug Console)

Dump the private key from your ServiceNode's pulic key.

```
walletpassphrase [your_wallet_passphrase] 600
dumpprivkey [mn_public_key]
```

Copy the resulting priviate key. You'll use it in the next step.

### From your multi-instance ServiceNode Wallet

Open your QT Wallet and go to console (from the menu select Tools => Debug Console)

Import the private key from the step above.

```
walletpassphrase [your_wallet_passphrase] 600
importprivkey [single_instance_private_key]
```

The wallet will re-scan and you will see your available balance increase by the amount that was in the imported wallet.

[Skip Option 2. and go to Create servicenode.conf file](#servicenodeconf)

## <a name="option2"></a>Option 2. Starting with a new wallet

[If you used Option 1 above, then you can skip down to Create servicenode.conf file.](#servicenodeconf)

### Create New Wallet Addresses

1. Open the QT Wallet.
2. Click the Receive tab.
3. Fill in the form to request a payment.
    * Label: mn01
    * Amount: 1000 (optional)
    * Click *Request payment*
5. Click the *Copy Address* button

Create a new wallet address for each ServiceNode.

Close your QT Wallet.

### Send 10,000 BlocknetDX to New Addresses

Just like setting up a standard MN. Send exactly 10,000 BlocknetDX to each new address created above.

### Create New Servicenode Private Keys

Open your QT Wallet and go to console (from the menu select Tools => Debug Console)

Issue the following:

```servicenode genkey```

*Note: A servicenode private key will need to be created for each ServiceNode you run. You should not use the same servicenode private key for multiple ServiceNodes.*

Close your QT Wallet.

## <a name="servicenodeconf"></a>Create servicenode.conf file

Remember... this is local. Make sure your QT is not running.

Create the servicenode.conf file in the same directory as your wallet.dat.

Copy the servicenode private key and correspondig collateral output transaction that holds the 1K BlocknetDX.

The servicenode private key may be an existing key from [Option 1](#option1), or a newly generated key from [Option 2](#option2). 

*Please note, the servicenode priviate key is not the same as a wallet private key. Never put your wallet private key in the servicenode.conf file. That is equivalent to putting your 10,000 BlocknetDX on the remote server and defeats the purpose of a hot/cold setup.*

### Get the collateral output

Open your QT Wallet and go to console (from the menu select Tools => Debug Console)

Issue the following:

```servicenode outputs```

Make note of the hash (which is your collaterla_output) and index.

### Enter your ServiceNode details into your servicenode.conf file
[From the blocknetdx github repo](https://github.com/blocknetdx-crypto/xcurrency/blob/master/doc/servicenode_conf.md)

The new servicenode.conf format consists of a space seperated text file. Each line consisting of an alias, IP address followed by port, servicenode private key, collateral output transaction id and collateral output index, donation address and donation percentage (the latter two are optional and should be in format "address:percentage").

```
alias ipaddress:port servicenode_private_key collateral_output collateral_output_index donationin_address:donation_percentage
```



Example:

```
mn01 127.0.0.1:51472 93HaYBVUCYjEMeeH1Y4sBGLALQZE1Yc1K64xiqgX37tGBDQL8Xg 2bcd3c84c84f87eaa86e4e56834c92927a07f9e18718810b92e0d0324456a67c 0
mn02 127.0.0.2:51472 93WaAb3htPJEV8E9aQcN23Jt97bPex7YvWfgMDTUdWJvzmrMqey aa9f1034d973377a5e733272c3d0eced1de22555ad45d6b24abadff8087948d4 0 7gnwGHt17heGpG9Crfeh4KGpYNFugPhJdh:25
```

## What about the xcurrency.conf file?

If you are using a servicenode.conf file you no longer need the xcurrency.conf file. The exception is if you need custom settings (thanks oblox). 

## Update xcurrency.conf on server

If you generated a new servicenode private key, you will need to update the remote xcurrency.conf files.

Shut down the daemon and then edit the file.

```sudo nano .xcurrency/xcurrency.conf```

### Edit the servicenodeprivkey
If you generated a new servicenode private key, you will need to update the servicenodeprivkey value in your remote xcurrency.conf file.

## Start your ServiceNodes

### Remote

If your remote server is not running, start your remote daemon as you normally would. 

I usually confirm that remote is on the correct block by issuing:

```xc3d getinfo```

And compare with the official explorer at http://blocknetdxexplorer.coin-server.com <or> dnet.presstab.pw

### Local

Finally... time to start from local.

#### Open up your QT Wallet

From the menu select Tools => Debug Console

If you want to review your servicenode.conf setting before starting the ServiceNodes, issue the following in the Debug Console:

```servicenode list-conf```

Give it the eye-ball test. If satisfied, you can start your nodes one of two ways.

1. servicenode start-alias [alias_from_servicenode.conf]. Example ```servicenode start-alias mn01```
2. servicenode start-many
